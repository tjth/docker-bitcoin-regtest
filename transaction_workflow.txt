This describes how to create a bitcoin transaction from Alice to Bob, sign it,
and mine it, all by using the command line with bitcoin-cli. Note that these
commands can be executed directly on the node or via the RPC server.

1) Create 3 nodes: Alice, Bob and miner Mike.
2) Start up bitcoin bitcoind on Alice, Bob and Mike using:
      bitcoind -regtest -daemon -printtoconsole
3) Connect Alice and Bob as peers:
      bitcoin-cli -regtest addnode 172.17.0.X onetry
4) Confirm they are peers:
      bitcoin-cli -regtest getpeerinfo
5) Do the same for Mike and Bob
6) Generate a block for Alice and Bob (to give them some currency)
      bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true
7) Mine 100 blocks with Mike to confirm the two blocks mined by
   Alice and Bob, releasing 50 BTC each.
      bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 100
8) Get a new address for Bob
      bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress
9) Send some BTC from Alice to this address
      bitcoin-cli -regtest sendtoaddress XXX 12.5
10) Mine 6 blocks with Mike to confirm the transaction
      bitcoin-cli -regtest setgenerate true 6
